# Licenses

## Beta Squad Games license

> The content of the contribution is owned by its author, who permits others to use it only if they follow these rules:
>  - Pay $X to receive permanent, transferrable usage rights for the contribution
>  - Y% of the revenue must go to benefactor
>  - Z% of the benefactor's revenue must go to the network

"Use" is a bit tricky here: it refers to the intended use of the content, e.g. to play chess using the custom chess piece, and not to simply looking at or accessing the content.
